1.1 INTRODUCTION
	Taqwa Water-Theme Park website is basically a website that offers the users to buy the ticket and book a room in our Taqwa Hotel. Since it is water theme-park, we would like to ease our clients by offering vouchers that they can purchase online to be used for the café inside Taqwa Water Theme Park. In order to use the vouchers their bracelets id – which is the tickets, will be scanned. Therefore, the clients will be able to enjoy to the fullest without worrying of their physical money being stolen.
Surely, this website offers discounts for the users if they buy from the website, instead of buying them at site.


1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
1.2.1 Background of the problem
The website we will be developing is to be used as a web application. Targeted users will be all people, without discriminating against their age and gender. The current offered theme-park or water theme-park website doesn't offer what is offered in their physical stores. Plus, usually, to reserve a room, they need to go another website since the website itself doesn't offer those services.
